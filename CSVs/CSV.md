## Information about CSVs

For this project to work, you need to download the **listings** and **reviews** files from the [Inside Airbnb datasets](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) for **Berlin** and **Munich**.

After downloading, please rename the files as follows:
- `listings_berlin.csv`
- `reviews_berlin.csv`
- `listings_munich.csv`
- `reviews_munich.csv`

Only after renaming the files correctly will the `setup_postgres.py` script work as intended.
